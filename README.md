# Commands-Menu
### This code is a flexible and easy way of displaying menu for commands. I customizeed this code for basic commands for now, but it can be appended with various commands.

## to run it on jupyter notebook-
###                   open jupyter notebook and call the function my_menu() to access various menu options. Such as opening any browser like firefox and chrome or opening notepad etc.

## to run it on bash-
###                   create a script file with this code and run with python3.

### I also added colors for showing running status. Green for SUCCESS, Red for FAILURE and Blue for EXITED menu. Also output is printed in gree while errors are shown in red.
